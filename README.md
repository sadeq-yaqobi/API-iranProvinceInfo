## Cache Utility Class

The [CacheUtility](https://github.com/sadeq-yaqobi/API-iranProvinceInfo/blob/main/App/Utilities/CacheUtility.php) class provides functionality for caching API responses to improve performance and reduce server load.

### Methods

- `init()`: Initializes cache file address and enables caching for GET requests.
- `cache_exists()`: Checks if a valid cached API response exists.
- `start()`: Starts buffering and serves a cached copy if available.
- `end()`: Caches captured output and sends it to the browser.
- `flush()`: Deletes cached files in the cache directory.

### Cache Configuration

- Cache is enabled when `CACHE_ENABLED` is set to true.
- Expiration time: 1 hour (`EXPIRE_TIME = 3600 seconds`).

### Usage Examples

To use caching:

1. Import the `CacheUtility` class.
2. Use `CacheUtility::start()` before generating API responses.
3. Call `CacheUtility::end()` after generating responses to save them.
4. Optionally, use `CacheUtility::flush()` to clear cached files.
